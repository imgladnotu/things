<h2>what is this?</h2>
some tf2 things that some may consider cheating.
<h2>why did you make this?</h2>
i want to share this with other people.
<h2>do you cheat?</h2>
depends on what you consider cheating.
<h2>how do i download these?</h2>
go into the "things" folder, followed by the "thing" you are looking for. in each "thing"'s folder, you will find more folders for the methods of doing/using a "thing".
<h2>why are they called "things"?</h2>
because some people consider these "cheats", others "exploits", and others "mods". it's not up to me to put these into categories and label them as "cheats" or not, so they are just "things".
<h2>i want to help, how can i?</h2>
make an issue.
<h2>where is your contact information?</h2>
i will not give you any, as that might allow you to harass me. please instead complain on reddit, discord, and various forums so that this can be seen by more people and make more people mad.
