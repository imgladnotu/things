<h2>how did this come about?</h2>

[this](https://www.teamfortress.tv/2203/why-is-flat-textures-blocked-by-sv-pure) is the oldest post i can find about flat textures, however the point where flat textures became popular was [cleantf2](https://www.teamfortress.tv/21756/prism-hud-clean-tf2), and then of course with [cleantf2+](https://www.teamfortress.tv/51736/cleantf2-nohats-flat-textures-etc) which allows you to generate them.
