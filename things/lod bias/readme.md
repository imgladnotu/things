<h2>what is it?</h2>

these programs will trick your tf2 into using lower quality mipmaps than you could normally get using `mat_picmip`. <br>
<h2>is it any good?</h2>

pros to this mod:<br>

* allows lower quality textures than mat_picmip
* can take advantage of the `-forceallmips` launch option
* works in live tf2 and in any source sdk 2013 multiplayer game, such as <b>team fortress 2 classic</b>

cons to this mod:<br>

* doesnt work with windows and intel integrated graphics combo
* there are different methods for windows amd, windows nvidia, and linux
* requires game restart to change
* windows + nvidia combo solution requires an outdated program
* linux solution is complicated (as always)
* requires an external program and may be detected by VAC in the future

originally, this was [posted on the ETF2L forum in 2011](https://etf2l.org/forum/customise/topic-17728/page-1/) and was [posted about again in 2016 on tftv](https://www.teamfortress.tv/35876/get-quake-like-textures-high-lod-bias-again), featuring a fix for nvidia users. later, in 2020, [another post on tftv was made about doing it on linux](https://www.teamfortress.tv/55182/how-to-do-the-lod-thing-on-linux).<br>
<h2>is it banned?</h2>

[RGL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jfp2o6X4m0zdrX50kZ5YNsrvBANqxfDb-nEsRBb1wh0/view) - on linux or using `-forceallmips` with a high enough lod bias you could be banned for having a transparent sniper scope<br>
